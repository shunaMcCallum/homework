# Collaborating on Git

**Lesson Duration: 10 minutes**

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to add collaborators on GitHub
- Be able to clone an existing repo and commit as a collaborator

## Introduction

Once you've created a new repository on GitHub, you can add collaborators to allow them access to push to your project.

## Partner 1: Steps for inviting collaborators

1) Visit your project's repository on GitHub

2) In the repository menu bar, click the three dots for more items and select `Settings`

3) On the `Settings` page, select `Manage access` from the side menu

4) On this page, select the green button `Add people`

5) Search for your collaborator by their GitHub username (you will ask your partner for this) select the correct account, and click the green button `Add <username> to this repository`

6) Your partner will now receive an email (to the email address associated with their GitHub account) inviting them to collaborate on this project's repository. Once they have viewed and accepted the invitation

## Partner 2: Steps for accepting invitation to collaborate

1) Check the email address associated with your GitHub account for an invite email

2) Click to view the invitation on GitHub (you'll need to be logged in) and select the green button `Accept invitation`. You now have push access to this repository

3) Clone the repository to your computer and start working. Remember to commit, push and pull alternatively with your partner so as to avoid a **git merge conflict** for now

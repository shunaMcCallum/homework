### MVP:
Code the areas for:
- Header with navigation
- Grid of favourite/top places
- Search Form 

### Extensions
Code the areas for:
* Search Form
* Testimonials
* Insert links and text onto the image boxes

The links shown do not have to do anything. (Ie they can just be links to www.google.com etc)

### Advanced Extension

Use media queries (under week_3/day_1 01_css_layout) to make the page responsive for mobile. Create a new `responsive.css` file to work in.

### NOTE: Alternatives
If you want you can emulate your own website if you want rather than the above travel example.

However there will be no start code for this but you can adapt the starter code for that fairly easily.

Some example websites that are nice to emulate are
https://www.gov.uk
and
https://www.shopify.co.uk/free-trial?term=shopify

## Getting Started

It is highly recommended that you start by breaking the design down into boxes. You can then start to decide which order to style each box in the HTML and consider how its contents should be structured. We suggest placing the images first on the page first in their respective CSS/HTML containers (flex/grid), the links and text on the images are extensions.

Feel free to discuss ideas with a member of your instructor team.

Your idea must have similar structure to the above example though and display good use of CSS Grid and/or Flexbox.

# PDA Homework - List & Dictionary in a Program

For the Personal Development Award (PDA) you are required to demonstrate your understanding of certain programming topics by collecting evidence (often code based) and writing about them.

The following two assignments are under the category of **Information and Technology (I.T.)**:


## I.T.5 - List in a Program

Demonstrate the use of a list in a program. Include in your screenshot(s):

* A list (that you’ve created) in a program
* A function (that you’ve created) that uses the list
* The result of the function running

Submit a comment explaining your understanding of:

* The use of lists in programs
* The code you’ve submitted


## I.T.6 - Dictionary in a Program

Demonstrate the use of a dictionary in a program. Include in your screenshot(s):

* A dictionary (that you’ve created) in a program
* A function (that you’ve created) that uses the dictionary
* The result of the function running

Submit a comment explaining your understanding of:
* The use of dictionaries in programs
* The code you’ve submitted


Remember:

* Show all relevant and referenced code in your screenshots
* Use original work that is your own (i.e. no start/end code handed out as course materials, copied from the internet, or submitted by another student)
* Reattach all files on any resubmission (when we start using the Canvas app)
* Do NOT reuse examples from another submission


## Example steps (for homework)
These are steps you could take for this homework. When we introduce Canvas, we will go over how to submit this work as evidence for the PDA.

0. Create a new folder and initialise a Git repository
1. In this folder, create a new Python file for each program
2. Create a variable and assign a list/dictionary with data to it
3. Define a function that takes (at least) a list/dictionary as a parameter and does something with it
4. Call the function and pass it the list/dictionary (using the variable) as the argument
5. Include a print() somewhere to show the effect of the function running
6. Run the program in terminal and check the print output is what you expect
7. In a comment at the bottom of the file, write a few sentences answering the questions: 1) What are lists/dictionaries used for in programming? 2) What is the code you’ve submitted doing?
8. Git commit your work regularly and push to GitHub. Submit the url of your GitHub repo via the Homework Submission Form.
